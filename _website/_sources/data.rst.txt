Data
===========================
GSLRetro tool requires reaction and molecule datasets for training neural networks and retrosynthetic planning.

For planning, the following datasets are needed

- building blocks set

For training, the following datasets are needed

- reaction dataset
- dataset of molecules for policy learning
- set of target molecules for value neural network self-training
- building blocks set



Reaction data cleaning
-------------------
Our tool includes a protocol for filtering incorrect and invalid reactions and extracting reaction rules.
This protocol is based on the complementary package GGRTools and includes several basic reaction checkers such as:

    * CheckCGRConnectedComponents - check if CGR contains unrelated components


    * CheckDynamicBondsNumber - check if there is unacceptable number of dynamic bonds in CGR


    * CheckSmallMolecules - check if there are only small molecules in the reaction or there is only one small reactant or product


    * CheckNoReaction - check if there is no reaction


    * CheckMultiCenterReaction - check if there is multi center reaction


    * CheckWrongCHBreaking - check if there is a C-C bond formation from breaking C-H (exclude condensation reactions and reactions with carbens)


    * CheckCCsp3Breaking - check if there is C(sp3)-C bonds breaking


    * CheckCCRingBreaking - check if there is ring C-C bonds breaking (5, 6, 7 atoms in rings)
