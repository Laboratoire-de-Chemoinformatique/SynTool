Ranking policy network
---------------------------

The ranking policy typically employs a supervised neural network trained on molecular representations like Morgan fingerprints
or molecular graphs. The network is trained to perform multi-class classification where for a given reaction:

    * The retro-rule extracted from that reaction is assigned as the positive class.
    * All other retro-rules extracted from the reaction database are assigned as negative classes.

This approach biases the network to prioritize transformations that are likely to produce reactions similar to real ones,
even without specific reaction conditions. However, it's important to note that reaction databases reflect historical data, and some useful rules might be underrepresented.
