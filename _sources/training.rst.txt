Training
===========================

**Data**

The following data files are required for retrosynthetic models training with Synto:

`reaction_data.rdf` - dataset of reactions for extraction of reaction rules

`policy_molecules.smi` - dataset of molecules for training policy neural network

`value_molecules.smi` - dataset of targets for self-tuning of value neural network

`building_blocks.smi` - building blocks in SMILES format (.smi or .txt)


**Full-pipeline execution**

Retrosynthetic models training is configured with the `config_training.yaml` configuration file :ref:`Configuration`.

For running retrosynthetic models training one needs three commands: (i) download training data and (ii)
run training pipeline:

.. code-block:: bash

    synto_training_data
    synto_training --config="training_config.yaml"
