Planning
===========================

**Data**

The following data files are required for retrosynthesis planning with Synto:

`reaction_rules.pickle` - extracted with Synto reaction rules stored as CGRtools objects

`building_blocks.smi` - building blocks in SMILES format (.smi or .txt)

`policy_network.ckpt` - pre-trained policy network (expansion function)

`value_network.ckpt` - pre-trained value network (evaluation function)


**Run planning**

Retrosynthesis planning is configured with the `config_planning.yaml` configuration file :ref:`Configuration`.

For running retrosynthesis planning one needs two commands: (i) download reaction rules and pre-trained neural networks
and (ii) run retrosynthesis planning:

.. code-block:: bash

    syntool_planning_data
    syntool_planning --config="planning_config.yaml"

**Planning results**

All retrosynthesis planning results are stored in the `results_root` folder specified in configuration file.
Found retrosynthesis pathways stored in HTML format and can be visually inspected:
