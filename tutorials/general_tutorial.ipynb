    "In SynTool, reaction data filtration is a crucial step to ensure the quality and accuracy of the data used for retrosynthesis analysis. The USPTO dataset, a standardized but unfiltered collection of reaction records, serves as the primary data source. However, this dataset may contain records with no reaction center or atom-to-atom mapping errors. To address this, we apply several filters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Reaction Filter**: Removes reactions with identical reactants and products.\n",
    "2. **Small Molecules Filter**: Excludes reactions where all reactants and products have â‰¤ specified number of heavy atoms.\n",

    "4. **Multi-Centre Reaction Filter**: Eliminates records with multiple reaction centers.\n",
    "5. **Csp3-C Breaking Filter**: Removes reactions where a bond between two sp3 carbons is broken, indicating potential mapping errors.\n",
    "6. **C-C Ring Breaking Filter**: Filters out reactions breaking a bond between two carbons in the same ring (sizes 5, 6, or 7), identified using the SSSR algorithm.\n",
    "7. **C-H Breaking Filter**: Removes reactions breaking a C-H bond to form a C-C bond, with exceptions for condensation reactions or those involving carbenes.\n",

    "After filtering the reaction data, the next crucial step in SynTool is the extraction of reaction rules. This process is vital for retrosynthetic analysis, as it defines the patterns and transformations that can be applied to synthesize target molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Extraction Protocol\n",
    "The protocol for extracting reaction rules from reactions in SynTool utilizes the CGRtools Python library. This procedure involves the following steps:\n",
    "1. **Substructure Extraction**: For each reactant and product in a given reaction, substructures containing the atoms of the reaction center and their immediate environment are extracted.\n",
    "2. **Substructure Exchange**: The reactant and product substructures are then exchanged.\n",
    "3. **Reagents Handling**: If the reaction includes reagents, they are not incorporated into the retro-rule.\n",
    "4. **Label Preservation**: All labels related to the atoms of the reaction center, such as hybridization, the number of neighbors, and the ring sizes in which the atoms participate, are preserved. For atoms in the first environment, only the sizes of rings are preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "A retrosynthetic transformation (reaction rules) formed by this protocol is applied to the product of the original reaction. If it successfully generates the reactants of the reaction, the rule is considered valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuring Rule Extraction\n",
    "The `ExtractRuleConfig` class in SynTool allows for the fine-tuning of how reaction rules are extracted. Key parameters of this class include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **multicenter_rules**: Determines whether a single rule is extracted for all centers in multicenter reactions (`True`) or if separate rules are generated for each center (`False`). Default is `True`.\n",
    "- **as_query_container**: When set to `True`, the extracted rules are formatted as `QueryContainer` objects, similar to SMARTS for chemical pattern matching. Default is `True`.\n",
    "- **reverse_rule**: If `True`, the direction of the reaction is reversed during rule extraction, which is useful for retrosynthesis. Default is `True`.\n",
    "- **reactor_validation**: Activates the validation of each generated rule in a chemical reactor to confirm accurate generation of products from reactants when set to `True`. Default is `True`.\n",
    "- **include_func_groups**: If `True`, specific functional groups are included in the reaction rule in addition to the reaction center and its environment. Default is `False`.\n",
    "- **func_groups_list**: Specifies a list of functional groups to be included when `include_func_groups` is `True`.\n",
    "- **include_rings**: Includes ring structures in the reaction rules connected to the reaction center atoms if set to `True`. Default is `False`.\n",
    "- **keep_leaving_groups**: Keeps the leaving groups in the extracted reaction rule when set to `True`. Default is `False`.\n",
    "- **keep_incoming_groups**: Retains incoming groups in the extracted reaction rule if set to `True`. Default is `False`.\n",
    "- **keep_reagents**: Includes reagents in the extracted reaction rule when `True`. Default is `False`.\n",
    "- **environment_atom_count**: Sets the number of layers of atoms around the reaction center to be included in the rule. A value of `0` includes only the reaction center, `1` includes the first surrounding layer, and so on. Default is `1`.\n",
    "- **min_popularity**: Establishes the minimum number of times a rule must be applied to be included in further analysis. Default is `3`.\n",
    "- **keep_metadata**: Preserves associated metadata with the reaction in the extracted rule when set to `True`. Default is `False`.\n",
    "- **single_reactant_only**: Limits the extracted rules to those with only a single reactant molecule if `True`. Default is `True`.\n",
    "- **atom_info_retention**: Dictates the level of detail retained about atoms in the reaction center and their environment. Default settings retain information about neighbors, hybridization, implicit hydrogens, and ring sizes for both the reaction center and its environment. Default settings:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    \n",

    "#### Configuring the Tree Search\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree search is configured using the `TreeConfig` class. Key parameters include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **max_iterations**: Defines the total number of iterations the algorithm will perform, essentially setting a limit on how many times the tree search loop can run. Default is 100 iterations.\n",
    "- **max_tree_size**: Sets the upper limit on the total number of nodes that can exist in the search tree, controlling the size and complexity of the tree. Default value is 10,000 nodes.\n",
    "- **max_time**: Specifies a time limit for the algorithm's execution, measured in seconds. This prevents the search from running indefinitely. The default time limit is 600 seconds (10 minutes).\n",
    "- **max_depth**: Determines the maximum depth of the tree, effectively controlling how far the search can go from the root node. The default maximum depth is 6 levels.\n",
    "- **ucb_type**: Chooses the type of Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm used in the search. Options include \"puct\" (predictive UCB), \"uct\" (standard UCB), and \"value\". The default is \"uct\".\n",
    "- **c_ucb**: This is the exploration-exploitation balance coefficient in UCB, which influences how much the algorithm favors exploration of new paths versus exploitation of known paths. The default coefficient is 0.1.\n",
    "- **backprop_type**: Selects the backpropagation method used during the search. Options are \"muzero\" (model-based approach) and \"cumulative\" (cumulative reward approach). The default is \"muzero\".\n",
    "- **search_strategy**: Determines the strategy for navigating the tree. Options are \"expansion_first\" (prioritizing the expansion of new nodes) and \"evaluation_first\" (prioritizing the evaluation of existing nodes). The default strategy is \"expansion_first\".\n",
    "- **exclude_small**: A boolean setting that, when true, excludes small molecules from the search, typically to focus on more complex molecules. The default is set to True.\n",
    "- **evaluation_agg**: This setting determines how the evaluation scores are aggregated. Options are \"max\" (using the maximum score) and \"average\" (using the average score). The default method is \"max\".\n",
    "- **evaluation_mode**: Defines the method used for node evaluation. Options include \"random\" (random evaluations), \"rollout\" (using rollout simulations), and \"gcn\" (graph convolutional networks). The default is \"gcn\".\n",
    "- **init_node_value**: Sets the initial value for newly created nodes in the tree. This can impact how nodes are prioritized during the search. The default initial value is 0.0.\n",
    "- **epsilon**: This parameter is used in the epsilon-greedy strategy during node selection, representing the probability of choosing a random action for exploration. A higher value leads to more exploration. The default value is 0.0.\n",
    "- **min_mol_size**: Defines the minimum size of a molecule (in terms of the number of heavy atoms) to be considered in the search. Molecules smaller than this threshold are typically considered as readily available building blocks. The default is set to 6 heavy atoms.\n",
    "- **silent**: When set to True, this option suppresses the progress output of the tree search, keeping the output clean and focused. The default setting is False."
